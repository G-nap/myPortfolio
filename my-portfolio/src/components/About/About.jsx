            I recently graduated in Computer Engineering from KMITL with a strong passion for becoming an expert in front-end development 
            and creating beautiful, functional designs (UX/UI). My experience is primarily rooted in collaborative work, where I have been 
            entrusted with responsibilities related to UI design and front-end development, utilizing technologies such as React.js, HTML,
             CSS, and JavaScript. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on front-end development, leveraging and expanding 
             my skills. I actively participated in API development and connected with SQL databases, broadening my knowledge. Eager to 
             continue learning, I am prepared to enhance my expertise in various aspects, including diverse roles, tools, and languages 
             associated with the assignments I undertake. Enthusiastic and dedicated, I am committed to furthering my skills in this 
             dynamic field.
